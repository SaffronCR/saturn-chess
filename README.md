Created thanks to the wonderful Jo Sega Saturn Engine: https://www.jo-engine.org/

And the Arduino MicroMax Chess program: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/rom3/arduino-uno-micromax-chess-030d7c

Gameplay and controls are pretty basic (it was created in a day), but it's fully playable from start to end.

## TODO

* Optimize polycount.
* Add more feedback to the player (show movements with animation, show last movements with an extra cursor, etc).
* Add audio cd tracks.
* Get better at chess to be able to beat this program :-)
